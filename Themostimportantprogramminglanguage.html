    <h2>The most important programming language </h2>
    We will not classify programming languages in any order. In the world of technology, the
    graphical line of programming languages changes according to the needs of the times,
    and we mention some important languages:
    <ol>
        <li>
            C ++: The language that does not die and it is a multi-use language, widely used to
            write algorithms and intermediaries between programming languages, in other words,
            C ++ is a language for low-level uses more than known uses, it is part of building the
            operating system and can deal with Memory , Hard disk, cache, etc. are stronger and
            faster which makes them better at it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Java: a strong and old language that is essentially suitable for almost all operating
            systems and for all uses, as we find it in office applications and smart phone
            applications in a large way.
        </li>
        <li>
            Python language: an ancient modern language that has received great attention in
            recent years and is used in web applications, office applications, and websites, and is
            also considered strong in the processes that need speed and flexibility so it occupied a
            large section regarding the applications of artificial intelligence and built a lot of
            libraries for this purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            PHP Language: A language used in website programming. It is a strong language
            and a high percentage of websites are built using it. It is dedicated to the part of the
            website related to the server and algorithms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Java Script language: One of the important multi-use languages, as we find it in
            websites and mobile applications in a big way and competing for other languages.
        </li>
        <li>C# : It is a mixed-use language developed by Microsoft Corporation, and it combines the characteristics of (C) and (C ++) languages, and it can be used in developing Windows operating system software.</li>
        <li>SQL: It is a language specialized in database programming. It is supported by many database management software, such as: MySQL (English: MySQL) and Microsoft Sequel (English: Microsoft SQL).</li>
        <li>Perl: It is a dynamic and versatile language used in developing web content, as well as web programs, graphics, and financial accounts.</li>
