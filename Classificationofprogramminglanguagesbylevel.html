    <h2>Classification of programming languages by level: </h2>
    Programming dialects can be grouped as far as their level into low-level programming dialects (English: Low-level), and elevated level programming dialects (English: High-level), and the level here is implied by the degree to which the language is stripped and handily comprehended by people, so the most dynamic dialects are machine language (Machine code) is viewed as a low-level programming language, and the closer the programming language to the machine language, the less it will be, since the machine language is trailed by the low level computing construct (English: Assembly language) , They are the least in the level, in machine language, orders are composed straightforwardly in the language that the PC comprehends, which is numbers, and in low level computing construct, orders are written in a marginally more straightforward manner than machine language, with the goal that a particular expression demonstrating the order is composed as opposed to written In numbers, for instance (MOV AL, 61h).
    Elevated level programming dialects are more straightforward and less conceptual than low-level dialects, so the best approach to compose and peruse them is simpler, and some of them may empower the chance of organizing the code in layouts (English: Classes), notwithstanding sparing the qualities in factors (in English: Variables), and making capacities (English: Functions), and that's just the beginning. Through elevated level programming dialects, a software engineer can, by composing just one line, cause the PC to execute an enormous number of orders.
