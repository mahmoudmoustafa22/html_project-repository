    <h2>programming languages: </h2>
    Communication with the computer has become much simpler and simpler than before, and thanks to the development of touch and speech recognition technologies, computers are able to "feel" us, understand our words, and even use the same language as us. On the contrary, when we send a voice command to our smart phone or to one of the smart digital aids, we do not use the “mother tongue” of the computer, but rather let the poor device take care of the process of understanding our words and analyzing it and then converting it to its mother tongue that the brain of the computer - i.e. the processor - can understand and interpret, Between the language we use and the language that the computer understands, there is a special pattern of intermediate languages that bears the burden of ensuring an effective communication process between us and the digital devices around us: they are the programming languages that millions of programmers around the world use to write different programs and applications that we use with every detail of our lives.
    Quite simply, Computer-Programming Language is a language with specific rules and frameworks that can be used to write programs and applications running on computers, leading to the implementation of a specific algorithm that will lead to the achievement of an output. When we say that the programming language is a grammar language, this means something quite similar to the spoken human languages, i.e. the programming language has certain limitations that must be followed while writing with it, and not following these rules will lead to the formation of grammatically incorrect programming lines, which is called the world of programming with a text error Syntax Error. Likewise also for spoken human languages, we can write grammatically correct script but it does not lead to any beneficial result, and this makes it semantic meaningless, and so, writing programs using one of the programming languages requires observing the rules to produce a correct syntax text with meaningful Semantic Meaningful .
